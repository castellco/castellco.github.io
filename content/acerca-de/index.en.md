My career began in Peru, working in academic research and development projects with people and organizations seeking to create real change. That's where I discovered that the problem was rarely a lack of data, but rather knowing how to turn it into information and knowledge.

That insight motivated me to expand my professional profile: I decided to specialize in data analysis and data science because I want to build that bridge between data and the decisions that truly matter, and to help rigorous evidence guide actions aligned with my personal purpose.

I currently work from Madrid on Vestas' global Construction Quality team. Here in Vestas, the world leader in sustainable energy, I collaborate with colleagues across five continents to create data-driven tools that enable continuous monitoring and improvement of our wind turbine quality, contributing to accelerating the energy transition.

So, I have two non-negotiables: having tangible impact in my role and working for an organization whose mission addresses problems that truly matter.

My experience includes:
- Data analysis in operational and development contexts
- Real-time data visualization (Power BI) and static visualizations (R, Python)
- Communicating complex insights in language accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences, because I firmly believe that speaking plainly is a way to democratize knowledge
- Quantitative and qualitative research
- R, Python, Power BI, SQL, Excel, and QGIS
